-  Hi, I’m @amyjenson
-  I’m interested in modeling aspects of subglacial hydrology using PDEs.
-  I’m currently in a graduate program in math at Montana State University. 
-  I’m collaborating with Jason Amundson at University of Alaska Southeast looking at the effect of glacial and basin geometry on outburst floods. @outburstflood
-  I'm also working with Scott McCalla and Mark Skidmore at Montana State University studying the effect of brine on the pressure dependent melting point of surrounding ice and the growth/creep closure of R-channels.
